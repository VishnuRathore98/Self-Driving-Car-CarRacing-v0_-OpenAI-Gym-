The following linux packages needs to be installed:

1. swig             
    SWIG, which stands for Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, 
    is an open-source software development tool primarily used to connect programs 
    written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages, including Python. 

    SWIG acts as a compiler that reads C/C++ header files and generates "wrapper" or "glue" code. 
    This wrapper code serves as an intermediary, allowing Python to call functions and access 
    data structures defined in the C/C++ code.

2. build-essential
    In Linux, "build-essential" is a meta-package that pulls in all the necessary tools and libraries 
    required to compile software from source code. 
    It's essentially a collection of packages that are commonly needed for building software, 
    particularly those written in C and C++. 

Follow the steps:

> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install swig build-essential
